<p><strong>Essentials</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 1 &nbsp;[OPTIONAL +1 point]: </strong>Objects. Start with the Squirrel program in the Week 4 example repository. <a href="https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/week4-examples/blob/master/javascript_objects/first-class-definition.js">https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/week4-examples/blob/master/javascript_objects/first-class-definition.js</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Modify it so that all Squirrels have a jump() method</li>
<li>Add all of your Squirrels to a list. Iterate over the list using a for loop. Print each squirrel's name, and called the .jump() method for each squirrel.</li>
<li>Reading: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Part 2: </strong>Working with Canvas elements. Can you create a page with a HTML canvas and draw a selection of lines, circles, and boxes of your choice on it?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp">http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp</a></p>
<p><strong>Part 3:</strong> Use the setInterval method to draw a circle moving across your canvas. You'll need to clear the canvas with clearRect(), and draw the circle in a new position every interval. (Here's an example of setInterval updating a canvas:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/week4-examples/blob/master/canvas/interval.html">https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/week4-examples/blob/master/canvas/interval.html</a>)&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Part 4:</strong> Look up the mousemove event. Create a page for a very simple drawing program. When you move the mouse over the canvas, mousemove events are generated. For every mousemove event, draw a small circle under the mouse pointer. So, the user will be able to use the mouse to draw.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Optional:</em> what else can you do with this? There's lots of possible additions, for example, changing the color being used to draw. &nbsp;Or, adding a clear button. Or, only drawing if a mouse button is held down (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mousemove">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mousemove</a>; can you use the button property?).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Also optional:</em> if you like the idea of what you can do with Canvas, but find the interface clunky, look up Fabric.js&nbsp;<a href="http://fabricjs.com/">http://fabricjs.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Part 5:</strong> Have you been commenting your code? If not, please start by commenting all of the code for this lab!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Part 6:</strong> Think about Project 1. Please discuss your ideas with me in class.&nbsp;<em> </em></p>

<p><strong>Advanced</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> Adding Google Maps to your website. &nbsp;Build the Getting Started application&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/fundamentals/adding-a-google-map">https://developers.google.com/maps/tutorials/fundamentals/adding-a-google-map</a>&nbsp;and note the location of the samples and reference; linked to from this page. There's another example in the GitHub samples for this week.</p>
<p>For this part, build a simple geography quiz&nbsp;game. Display a Google Map with three unlabeled markers on, for example, one on Minneapolis, one on Milwaukee and one on Madison. Your page should ask the user to guess which of the three markers is (for example) Madison. The user will click on one of the markers, and your page should respond by displaying a message telling the user if they correctly identified the city.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> You should display an unlabeled Satellite map; and remove the Map Controls (the box that offers Satellite, Roadmap, Terrain) so the user can't cheat.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3:</strong> Add more levels to this game, for example 3 sets of cities. Display the first set of cities for the user to guess; then the second set; then the 3rd set. After the user has guessed all three, display their score out of 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[Optional +1 point] Part 4:</strong> Let the user choose the number of cities, and the number of times they want to play.</p>
<p><strong>[Optional +4 points, tricky! ] - Part 5: </strong>How could you remove the hard-coded cities? How could you pick and display a variable number of random cities? Picking a random latitude and longitude is simple enough, but how can you identify the nearest city? You'll need to do some geocoding/reverse geocoding (This is a little tricky, but good practice reading API documentation).&nbsp;Now the user should be able to select how many cities will be in a set; and how many levels to play. Keep score and display it. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding</a></p>
